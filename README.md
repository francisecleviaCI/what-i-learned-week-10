It's *only* been 11 weeks!
___

1. Objects are a 'container' of different properties that describe the object. For example, if an object was the amazing human Francis, the properties that could be contained in the object would be his hair color, height, age, and place of birth.
    - Object Literals- One way an object is displayed is by using object literals. They are comma separated, property and value pairs that are contained within the object curly brackets.
    - Object Methods- Some object properties can serve as object methods. These methods contain functions that can affect the object itself.

2. Call Back- A call back is a function passed into another function. It can be executed immediately or delayed. Usually things are executed in sequentil order(top-down) in JavaScript, but sometimes we need a function to be executed with a delay, waiting on something else to be completed.

3. Todo Node App

4. JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)
    - Every JSON file is a valid Javascript object
    - Every object is not valid JSON
    - Every string has to have double quotes around it
